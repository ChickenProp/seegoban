seegoban - take a photo of a Go board and write the position in SGF.

Usage: seegoban <photo>

To use, click on the corners of the board. A grid will appear overlaying the
board. If necessary, you can adjust any of the corners by clicking near
them. When satisfied, you can press enter to write the board position in a
simple text format, or 's' to write it in SGF, or 'd' to get full information
about the board position in a format intended for debugging. If you have the
program 'cgoban' installed, you can press 'c' to open a cgoban window with the
current board position.

To see where seegoban is making mistakes, you can tell it what the correct board
position is. To do this, pass the -e switch on the command line, like:

$ seegoban -e correct.txt board.png

After placing the grid, you can press 'e' to find out which stones are being
detected incorrectly. If you have the program 'xgraph' installed, you can also
press 'v' to view a graph of the distribution of the stones. The x axis is
brightness, the y axis is saturation. Each point represents an intersection: the
brightness and saturation of the points around that intersection, and the colour
that should be detected there, regardless of what seegoban actually detects.
(Red for no stone, green for black, blue for white). You can also press 'g' to
print this data in a format suitable for input to xgraph. If you don't pass the
-e switch, 'v' and 'g' still work, but only one data set (containing a point for
every intersection) is displayed.

The grid can also be placed from the command line. For each corner, pass the
switch '-c x,y', where x and y are the coordinates on the full-sized image with
the origin in the top left. If fewer than four corners are given, the rest may
be placed from within the program.

If the grid is placed from the command line, you can run seegoban
noninteractively. The '-a' switch will cause seegoban to print the board
position and exit without displaying a window. The output format can be selected
with further command-line options:
-t		simple text
-s		SGF (default)
-d		debug
-e <file>	incorrectly detected stones

Currently it doesn't get great results, but that will improve as I learn what
heuristics to use.

Heuristics:

To work out whether there is a stone at a given point, we take the average color
of a 6x6 block surrounding it. If this color has saturation greater than 65, we
assume there is no stone there. Otherwise the stone is assumed to be black if
its brightness is less than 160, or white otherwise.

Representing a color as (r,g,b), its saturation is max{r,g,b} - min{r,g,b} (as
in HSV colorspace) and its brightness is .30*r + .59*g + .11*b (which according
to wikipedia is fairly accurate in terms of how we perceive brightness).

I intend to make these thresholds editable while seegoban is running, and to
have more intelligent boundaries. My current plan, given a point of brightness B
and saturation S is: if w*B - x*S > m, there is a white stone there; if y*B +
z*S < n, there is a black stone there; otherwise, there is no stone there.
Suitable values for w, x, y, z, m, n are as-yet unknown, but I'm working on
being able to collect that data.

Todo:

* Webcam support
* Proper GUI
* Automate operation from the command line
* Preview of results
* Select an SGF editor other than cgoban

Bugs:

* The grid is scaled along with the board, which can cause lines not to show up
  very well.
