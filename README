seegoban - take a photo of a Go board and write the position in SGF.

Usage: seegoban <photo>

To use, click on the corners of the board. A grid will appear overlaying the
board, with the centre point marked. If necessary, you can adjust any of the
corners or the centre by clicking near them. When satisfied, press enter to
write the board position in SGF.

Currently it's only been tested on one photo (included), and doesn't get perfect
results even on that, but it will hopefully improve.

Heuristics:

To work out whether there is a stone at a given point, we take the average color
of a 6x6 block surrounding it. If this color has saturation greater than 50, we
assume there is no stone there. Otherwise the stone is assumed to be black if
its brightness is less than 150, or white otherwise.

Representing a color as (r,g,b), its saturation is max{r,g,b} - min{r,g,b} (as
in HSV colorspace) and its brightness is .30*r + .59*g + .11*b (which according
to wikipedia is fairly accurate in terms of how we perceive brightness).

I intend to make these thresholds editable while seegoban is running.

No scaling for perspective is done. Grid lines are evenly spaced up to the
centre point, then evenly spaced after it. This turns out to be inadequate, so
I'll add two-point perspective scaling at some point.

Todo:

* Webcam support
* Proper GUI
* Preview of results
* Edit board in cgoban (or sgf editor of choice)
